# Leaflet Challenge: Visualizing Geological Survey Data

## Background
This repository centers around using Leaflet to help visualize data for the United States Geological Survey which is often shortened to USGS. The USGS provides scientific data about natural harzards, both our ecosystem's and environment's health; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists work to develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. I was given a fictional task of helping out the USGS with a new project.

In this fictional project, the USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that allows them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world every day, but there is currently no meaningful way of displaying all this data. The hope is that if we can visualize the data, it will allow the USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (which could lead to more funding) on issues that are facing the planet presently.
